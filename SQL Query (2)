#SQL Query (2)

Actually if we want a quick summary of the LPSUBSFLAG and total counts

With results set

SELECT
    LPSUBSFLAG,
    (ORDER_DATE_EST = ACCOUNT_CREATED_DATE_EST) AS dates_match,
    COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM
    DB_DBTDEV.DBT_LKHATRI.SUBSCRIPTION__FCT_ORDERS_BY_OPIN_PARTNERS
WHERE
    COUNTRY_NAME = 'PHILIPPINES'
    AND OPIN_PARTNER = 'SMART'
GROUP BY
    LPSUBSFLAG,
    dates_match
ORDER BY
    LPSUBSFLAG,
    dates_match DESC;
